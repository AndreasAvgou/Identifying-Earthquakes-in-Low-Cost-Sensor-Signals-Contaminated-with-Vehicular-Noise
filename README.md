# Identifying Earthquakes in Low-Cost Sensor Signals Contaminated with Vehicular Noise

An amalgamated deep neural network constituent of a DNN trained on earthquake signals from professional sensory equipment as well as a DNN trained on vehicular signals from low-cost sensors for the purpose of earthquake identification in signals from low-cost sensors contaminated with vehicular noise
