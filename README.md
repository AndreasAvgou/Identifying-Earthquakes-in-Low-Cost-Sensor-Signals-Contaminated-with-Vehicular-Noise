ABSTRACT = {The importance of monitoring earthquakes for disaster management, public safety, and scientific research can hardly be overstated. The emergence of low-cost seismic sensors offers potential for widespread deployment due to their affordability. Nevertheless, vehicular noise in low-cost seismic sensors presents as a significant challenge in urban environments where such sensors are often deployed. In order to address these challenges, this work proposes the use of an amalgamated deep neural network constituent of a DNN trained on earthquake signals from professional sensory equipment as well as a DNN trained on vehicular signals from low-cost sensors for the purpose of earthquake identification in signals from low-cost sensors contaminated with vehicular noise. To this end, we present low-cost seismic sensory equipment and three discrete datasets that—when the proposed methodology is applied—are shown to significantly outperform a generic stochastic differential model in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},
